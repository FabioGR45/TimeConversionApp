# TimeConversionApp

###Project of a program developed in C#, which converts values to seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.

####How to use the program:

- When starting the program, write the type of time to serve as the basis for conversion, according to the options presented in the console.

- After writing the base time type, write the time type you want to get as a conversion result.

####Example:

1st step - seconds

2nd step - minutes

final result: 60 seconds equals 1 minute.

####objective of this project:

The purpose of this project is merely a test project and study of C# programming

####Things I would like to do or add soon:

- In the future add some other types of time to serve as conversion.

- Refactor and make the code cleaner using SOLID practice
